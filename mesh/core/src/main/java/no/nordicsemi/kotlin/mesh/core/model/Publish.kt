/**
 * The publish object represents parameters that define how the messages are published by a mesh
 * model.
 *
 * @property address            The address property contains the publication address for the model
 *                              containing a [Address].
 * @property index              The index property contains an integer that represents an
 *                              [ApplicationKey] index, indicating which Application Key to use for
 *                              the publication. The application key index corresponds to the index
 *                              value of one of the application key entries in the node’s appKeys
 *                              array.
 * @property ttl                The ttl property contains an integer from 0 to 127 that represents
 *                              the Time to Live (TTL) value for published messages or an integer
 *                              with a value of 255 that indicates that the node’s default TTL is
 *                              used for publication.
 * @property period             The period property refers to [PublishPeriod] that describes the
 *                              interval between subsequent publications. If the value of this
 *                              property is 0, the periodic publication is disabled.
 * @property credentials        The [Credentials] property contains an integer of 0 or 1 that
 *                              represents whether managed flooding security material (0) or
 *                              friendship security material (1) is used.
 * @property retransmit         The [Retransmit] property describes the number of times a message is
 *                              published and the interval between retransmissions of the published
 *                              messages.
