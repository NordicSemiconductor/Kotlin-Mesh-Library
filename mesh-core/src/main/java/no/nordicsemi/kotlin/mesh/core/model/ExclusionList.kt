/**
 * Represents a list of unicast addresses that are excluded by a Mesh Manager for a particular IV
 * index.
 *
 * After a node is removed from a network, other nodes keep SeqAuth values associated with addresses
 * used by the removed node. Packets sent from a new node using the same set of addresses would be
 * discarded until the new sequence numbers would get higher then the what is in Replay Protection
 * List or the receivers. Therefore, until the IV index is incremented by 2, the addresses of a
 * removed node are reserved and cannot be assigned to a new node. When the IV index increments by
 * at least 2, the SeqAuth is guaranteed to be higher, no matter what the sequence number used by
 * the new node would be, therefore the addresses can be reassigned.
 *
 * @property ivIndex       32-bit value that is a shared network resource known by all nodes in a
 *                         given network.
 * @property addresses     List of excluded addresses for a given ivIndex.
 * @constructor            Creates an ExclusionList object.
