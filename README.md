# A Kotlin library for Bluetooth Mesh

The nRF Mesh library allows to provision [Bluetooth® Mesh](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/feature-enhancements/mesh/)
devices into a mesh network, configure them and send and receive messages.

The library is compatible with the following [Bluetooth specifications](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/?types=adopted&keyword=mesh):
- Mesh Protocol 1.0.1
- Uses Mesh Protocol 1.1 lower transport features.
- Mesh Model 1.1
- Mesh Configuration Database Profile 1.0.1
  
> [!Note]
> [**Mesh Device Properties**](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/device-properties/) are still work in progress

## Supported features

1. Provisioning with:
   - OOB[^1] Public Key (most secure)
   - Input and Output OOB
   - No OOB (insecure)
   - Enhanced security, added in Mesh Protocol 1.1
   - Remote Provisioning (requires a node with Remote Provisioning Server model to proxy provisioning messages)
2. Configuration, including managing keys, publications, subscription, and heartbeats (both as client and server).
3. Support for client and server models.
4. Groups, including those with virtual labels.
5. Scenes (both as client and server).
6. Managing proxy filter.
7. IV Index update (handled by Secure Network beacons).
8. [Key Refresh Procedure](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-nRF-Mesh-Library/pull/314) 
   (using *ConfigKeyRefreshPhaseSet* messages, not Secure Network beacon). 
9. Heartbeats (both as client and server).
10. Exporting network state with format compatible to 
    [Configuration Database Profile 1.0.1](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/mesh-configuration-database-profile-1-0-1/), 
    including partial export.
11. Option to use own transport layer with default GATT Bearer implementation available.

[^1]: OOB - Out Of Band

### NOT (yet) supported features

The following features are not (yet) supported:

1. The rest of models defined by Bluetooth SIG - *PRs are welcome!*
2. IV Index update (initiation) - *not a top priority, as other nodes may initiate the update.*
3. Health server messages - *in our TODO list.*

## How to start

The library can be included as a project and will be avialable on maven central in the near future.

Product documentation is available here: [Documentation](https://nordicsemiconductor.github.io/IOS-nRF-Mesh-Library/documentation/nordicmesh).

## nRF Mesh sample app

Most of the features listed above are demonstrated in nRF Mesh sample application.

The app is not yet published to playstore but is available on this repo.

### Supported features

1. Provisioning with all available features.
2. Configuration of local and remote nodes. 
3. Managing network (provisioners, network and application keys, scenes), resetting and exporting configuration.
4. Managing groups, including those with virtual labels.
5. Sending group messages.
6. UI for local models, which include: 
   - Generic OnOff Client and Server,
   - Generic Level Client and Server,
   - Simple OnOff vendor model by Nordic not supported yet.
   - Mesh vendor model by Nordic not supported yet.
7. Support for some server models:
   - Generic OnOff,
8. Scenes, both as client and server.
9. Automatic connection to nearby nodes and automatic proxy filter management.
10. IV Index test

## Testing

All features are tested against nRF5 devices running [nRF5 SDK for Mesh](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/nRF5-SDK-for-Mesh) 
and [nRF Connect SDK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/nRF-Connect-SDK) firmware.

## Requirements

* An Android Device with android 4.3 or newer device with BLE capabilities.

### Optional

* [nRF5 Development Kit(s)](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Bluetooth-mesh/Development-hardware) for developing and testing firmware.
