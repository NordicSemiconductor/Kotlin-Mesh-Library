        network configuration stored on this device.\n\nWhen sharing with a Guest, consider creating
        a new network key and set of guest application keys, send them to nodes that you want to
        share with the guest, and bind to required models. Then export only this network key with
        excluded device keys. \n\nThe underlying library allows also to specify which nodes, groups
        or scenes are to be shared. This app will only share those, that use the specified network
        key.
